# The Elevators

A simple elevator app written in typescript, plain javascript, css, and html that allows travelling between floors given it's `pickup` and `destination` points.

You may customize the number of Elevators and it's floors (*set floor count is same for all elevators*) by change the parameter value of the main ElevatorManager class upon instance creation `new ElevatorManager(n, n)`.
